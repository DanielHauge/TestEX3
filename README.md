# Test excercise 3 (Test Case Design Exercise)
This is a mini project for the test course. The exercise is based off the description in this [resource](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2018spring-test-teaching-material/blob/master/exercises/Test%20Case%20Exercises.pdf)

## Description



The result is this repository that include blabla bla and below documentation.


### Equivalence classes

- 1). Make equivalences classes for the input variable for this method: 
```java
public boolean isEven(int n)
```
------------------------

- 2). Make equivalances classes for an input variable that represents a mortgage applicant's salary. The valid range is $1000 pr. month to $75,000 pr. month.

### State Transition

- 1). Make a state diagram hat depicts the state of MyArrayListWithBugs.java and show the events that cause a change from one state to another. (ie. transition.)

- 2). Derive test cases from the state diagram

- 3). Implement automated unit tests uning the test cases above.

- 4). Detect, locate and fix as many errors as possible in the class
>- a. 
>- b. 
>- c.
>- d. 

- 5). Consider whether a state table is more useful design technique. Comment on that.

- 6). Make a conclusion where you specify the level of test coverage and argue for your chosen level:
